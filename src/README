Compile with makefile:
bash$ make

Run:
bash$ ./virtual-mem -a[] -f[] -o[OPFS] [Input file] [random file]


compile manually:
bash$ g++ virtual-mem.cpp

Run:
bash$ ./a.out -a[] -f[] -o[OPFS] [Input file] [random file]

The -f,-a,-o, arguments can be in any order, but the rest need to be in that order. It might act up if you don't give it arguments-- no -o, it'll be fine, but no -f or -a will be problematic, I didn't set defaults.
